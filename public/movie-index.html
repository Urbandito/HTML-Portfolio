<h1>The Best Movies According to me, Ervin Padilla</h1>
<h2>
  Preface: I am not in anyway a film auteur or can critique with any sense of
  film knowledge. I am very biased to how I was feeling in the momenet of
  watching the movie and I judge movies based on that. Sometimes I'll add a
  retrospective where I can look back on a movie with non rose tinted glasses
  but usually it'll just be my first impressions.

<h3>La La Land (2016) Review Written (1/31/2024)</h3>
<p>
  This movie really caught me by surprise. Mostly because I actually did not
  know it was a musical when I first saw it. I just saw that it was really
  popular, it was nominated for a bunch of oscars, and also it had a really
  stunning movie poster. What surprised me the most about this movie was that it
  was a musical, but it really didn't have that much music. It is actually like
  70% drama and 30% music. Also the music isn't really that strong. I'm not
  saying that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling aren't better singers than me, I'm
  just saying they are no Beyonce.

  With that said the big thing that carries this movie is the believeable
  writing and character development, as well as the great acting by the 2 leads.
  Ryan Gosling may talk in monotone in 80% of his roles but his face can really
  invoke emotions that I might not have even felt yet. He can express gritted
  interest as well as content longing with just a sly curl of his mouth.

  Emma Stone on the other hand. I am in love with this woman. She is the whole
  package. Even in that godawful Amazing Spider-Man 2 she was one of the only
  shining specks of entertainment that shone through that murky mess. La La
  Land, allows her to actually be an interesting character. Unlike Goslings
  typical more reserved act, Stone is a much more vibrant character, as well as
  just more visually colorful from her rosy red cheeks down to the stunning
  dresses she wears.

  While La La Land may not thread any new ground in terms of drama or musical
  tropes, it is masterfully executed in writing, acting and direction. If it is
  your first foray into the genre I think it is a great appetizer for the more
  flamboyant and grand musicals of old.<br />I give La La Land a thumbs up
